# Components Directory

This directory contains all reusable components used throughout the application.

## Structure

- `ui/`: Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, inputs, etc.)
- `forms/`: Form-related components and form field components
- `layouts/`: Layout components and page structure components

## Guidelines

1. All components should be in PascalCase
2. Each component should have its own directory with:
   - Component file (index.tsx)
   - Styles (if needed)
   - Tests
   - Types (if complex)
3. Components should be as pure as possible
4. Use TypeScript for all components
5. Follow the AstroAware style guide for all UI components
