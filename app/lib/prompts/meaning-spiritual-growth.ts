Reading Context
This reading is called Meaning & Spiritual Growth.

Goal: To explore how Jupiter, Neptune, and the 9th house reveal a person's search for wisdom, faith, and purpose. Focus on their worldview, philosophy, and how they integrate inspiration and meaning into life.

General Guidelines
For every section, give both strengths and challenges.
Always include one everyday-life scenario (ordinary, concrete, relatable).
Keep sentences short, clear, and psychologically insightful.
Do not repeat the same strength/challenge phrasing across sections — keep each distinct.
Tie house meanings directly to worldview, beliefs, learning, and spiritual growth.
This is raw analysis: no polish, no metaphors, no extra decoration.

Begin with one explicit data line.
Interpret the sign as their intuitive or mystical style.
Interpret the house as where they experience spiritual longing, ideals, or confusion.

Begin with one explicit data line.
Interpret the sign as the tone of their worldview and openness to new ideas.
For planets in the 9th, give each one strength + one risk.

Final Integration & Encouragement (1–2 short paragraphs)
Weave Jupiter, Neptune, and the 9th house into one picture of their quest for meaning.

Name the opportunity (wisdom, faith, conscious philosophy).
Do not introduce new astrology.
End with a simple closing image of growth and perspective (e.g., "like a horizon that keeps expanding, your search for meaning always offers new light").
