Reading Context
This reading is called Self-Worth & Personal Values.

Goal: To explore how the Sun, the 2nd house, and (optionally) Jupiter/Venus reveal a person's sense of worth, confidence, and personal values. Focus on how they define their own value, what they prize, and how this shapes confidence and choices.

General Guidelines
For every section, give both strengths and challenges.
Always include one everyday-life scenario (ordinary, concrete, relatable).
Keep sentences short, clear, and psychologically insightful.
Do not repeat the same strength/challenge phrasing across sections — each must feel distinct.
Tie house meanings directly to self-worth, values, confidence, and possessions.
This is raw analysis: no polished prose, no decorative metaphors.

Section Instructions

Orientation (4–6 sentences)
List Sun placement: "Sun in <sign> in the <house>, aspects: <list>."
List 2nd house placement: "2nd house in <sign>; planets in 2nd: <list>."
If active, list Jupiter/Venus placement: "Jupiter in <sign> in the <house>; Venus in <sign> in the <house>."
End with one plain line linking each factor to the theme: Sun = identity & confidence, 2nd house = values & resources, Jupiter/Venus = growth & pleasure in self-worth.
No interpretation here.

The Sun — Core Self & Confidence (heaviest, 2–4 paragraphs)
Start with one explicit data line.
Interpret the sign as their style of self-expression and source of vitality.
Interpret the house as where confidence is tested and built.
For aspects, give each one strength + one challenge.
End with one everyday example (e.g., "feeling proud when completing a project, but doubting if it's 'good enough'").

2nd House — Self-Worth & Values (second heaviest, 2–3 paragraphs)
Start with one explicit data line.
Interpret the 2nd house sign as how they measure worth and security.
For planets in the 2nd, give each its own strength + challenge.
Always link back to inner value vs. external measures.
End with one everyday example (e.g., "feeling secure after paying bills, or anxious when the account balance is low").

Jupiter/Venus (optional) — Expansion & Pleasure in Self-Worth (light, 1–2 paragraphs)
Start with explicit data lines.
Interpret Jupiter as optimism and growth around values/resources.
Interpret Venus as how pleasure, beauty, or love color their sense of worth.
Give one strength + one challenge for each.
End with one everyday example (e.g., "treating yourself to something nice, but worrying if it's excessive").

Final Integration & Encouragement (1–2 short paragraphs)
Weave Sun + 2nd house (+ Jupiter/Venus if active) into one portrait of their self-worth style.
Name the recurring challenge (externalizing worth, tying value to possessions, etc.).
Name the opportunity (confidence, creativity, steady values).
Do not introduce new astrology.
End with a simple image of inner worth (e.g., "like a flame that burns steadily, your value doesn't depend on what surrounds it").
