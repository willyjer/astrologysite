Reading Context
This reading is called Drive & Ambition.

Goal: To explore how Mars, Pluto, and the 10th House/Midheaven reveal a person's motivation, willpower, and sense of direction in life. Focus on ambition, drive, obstacles, and how power and purpose are expressed.

General Guidelines
For every section, give both strengths and challenges.
Always include one everyday-life scenario (ordinary, concrete, relatable).
Keep sentences short, direct, and clear.
Do not repeat the same strength/challenge phrasing across sections. Each must feel distinct.
Tie house meaning directly to ambition, goals, achievement, or drive (not generic "life focus").
This is raw analysis: no flowery prose, no polish.

Section Instructions

Orientation (4–6 sentences)
List Mars placement: "Mars in <sign> in the <house>, aspects: <list>."
List Pluto placement: "Pluto in <sign> in the <house>, aspects: <list>."
List Midheaven/10th placement: "Midheaven in <sign>; planets in 10th: <list>."
End with one plain line linking each factor to the theme of drive & ambition: Mars = drive & energy, Pluto = willpower & intensity, MC/10th = goals & public direction.
Do not add interpretation here.

Mars — Energy & Motivation (1–3 paragraphs, ≤130 words each)
Begin with one explicit data line.
Interpret the sign as their natural energy style and way of asserting themselves.
Interpret the house as where they most directly channel their drive toward achievement.
Aspects: For each aspect, describe one clear supportive strength and one tension challenge.
End with one everyday-life example showing how their Mars energy shapes ordinary ambition (e.g., "pushing through a morning run before work to feel accomplished").

Pluto — Power & Transformation (1–3 short paragraphs)
Start with one explicit data line.
Interpret the sign as their core style of inner power or compulsion.
Interpret the house as the area where they seek control, transformation, or influence.
Aspects: describe one constructive use of power (strength) and one potential pitfall (challenge).
Keep focus on ambition, influence, and resilience in the pursuit of goals.
End with one small, ordinary example that shows Pluto dynamics in action (e.g., "getting absorbed in reorganizing a messy project until it feels completely renewed").

10th House / Midheaven — Life Direction & Public Path (1–3 short paragraphs)
Start with one explicit data line.
Interpret the Midheaven sign as the style of their career ambitions and public goals.
For planets in the 10th, give each its own interpretation: One supportive quality for ambition. One risk or pressure it creates.
Tie this directly to their motivation and how they pursue external achievement.
End with one concrete career/public scenario (e.g., "feeling both pride and pressure during a work presentation").

Final Integration & Encouragement (1–2 short paragraphs)
Weave Mars, Pluto, and MC/10th themes into a single picture of how ambition shows up for them.
Name the challenge (patterns of overdrive, control, or fear of failure).
Name the opportunity (resilience, focus, capacity for meaningful leadership).
Do not introduce new astrology.
End with a simple metaphor or image that leaves them with confidence in their ambition (e.g., "like a forge that tempers steel, your drive shapes both strength and purpose").
