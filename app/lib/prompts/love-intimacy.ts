Reading Context
This reading is called Love & Intimacy Patterns.

Goal: To explore how Venus, the 7th house/Descendant, and (optionally) the 5th house reveal a person's relationship style, attraction patterns, and ways of opening to intimacy. Focus on how they love, what they seek, and where challenges in closeness and trust may arise.

General Guidelines
- For every interpretive section, include both supportive traits and potential challenges (when relevant).
- Always include everyday-life scenarios, but keep them concise and ordinary.
- Keep sentences short, clear, and psychological.
- Do not repeat the same strength/challenge phrasing across sections — each must feel distinct.
- Tie house meanings directly to partnership, love, romance, or trust.
- This is raw analysis: no polish, no metaphors.

Section Instructions

Orientation (4–5 sentences)
- List Venus placement: "Venus in <sign> in the <house>, aspects: <list>."
- List Descendant/7th house placement: "Descendant in <sign>; planets in 7th: <list>."
- List 5th house placement: "5th house in <sign>; planets in 5th: <list>."
- End with one plain linking sentence: "Venus = love style & attraction, 7th = partnership patterns, 5th = romance/play."
- No interpretation, no examples.

Venus — Style of Loving & Attraction (heaviest section, 3–4 paragraphs)
- Begin with one explicit data line.
- Interpret the sign (how affection is shown, what is valued in love).
- Interpret the house (where intimacy/attraction show up most directly).
- For each aspect: give at least 2 sentences (1 supportive trait + 1 challenge).
- If Venus has no aspects: expand further on the combined influence of sign + house to keep the section full.
- End with 2 everyday-life examples that show contrasting expressions of affection (e.g., one nurturing, one playful/passionate).

7th House / Descendant — Partnership Dynamics (largest section, 2–3 paragraphs)
- Begin with one explicit data line.
- Interpret the Descendant sign (qualities sought in others, approach to one-on-one partnerships).
- If planets are in the 7th: give one clear strength + one clear challenge for each planet.
- If the 7th is empty: expand more fully on the Descendant sign themes (at least 2 detailed paragraphs).
- Structure the section so each paragraph highlights a different dimension:
  - Paragraph 1 → what they seek in partners, attraction style, partnership ideals.
  - Paragraph 2 → trust, conflict patterns, and challenges with balance.
  - Paragraph 3 (if planets present) → how each planet adds unique strengths + risks.
- End with 1 specific everyday-life example of partnership dynamics.

5th House (optional) — Romance & Passion (lighter section, 1–2 short paragraphs)
- Begin with one explicit data line (only if relevant).
- Interpret the cusp sign (style of romance/playfulness).
- For planets in the 5th: give each its own supportive quality + risk.
- If more than one planet: split into 2 short paragraphs for clarity.
- If the 5th is empty: interpret the cusp sign fully in 1 short paragraph.
- Always include 1 playful, lighthearted everyday-life example (e.g., flirty text, teasing, spontaneous date).

Final Integration & Encouragement (1–2 short paragraphs)
- Weave Venus, 7th house, and (if relevant) 5th house into one picture of how they love and relate.
- Clearly state one repeating challenge/dynamic.
- Clearly state one growth opportunity.
- Name one repeating partner type or pattern explicitly (e.g., "attracted to adventurous but inconsistent partners").
- No strengths/challenges here, no examples, no metaphors (the editor will polish).
