Reading Context
This reading is called Mind & Communication Style.

Goal: To explore how Mercury, the 3rd house, and (optionally) the 9th house reveal a person's thought processes, communication habits, and learning style. Focus on how they think, express themselves, and interact with ideas and people.

General Guidelines
For every section, give both strengths and challenges.
Always include one everyday-life scenario (ordinary, concrete, relatable).
Keep sentences short, clear, and psychological.
Do not repeat the same strength/challenge phrasing across sections — each must feel distinct.
Tie house meanings directly to mental habits, communication, learning, and worldview.
This is raw analysis: no polished prose, no decorative metaphors.

Section Instructions

Orientation (4–6 sentences)
List Mercury placement: "Mercury in <sign> in the <house>, aspects: <list>."
List 3rd house placement: "3rd house in <sign>; planets in 3rd: <list>."
If active, list 9th house placement: "9th house in <sign>; planets in 9th: <list>."
End with one plain line linking each factor to the theme: Mercury = mind, 3rd = daily communication, 9th = broader worldview.
No interpretation here.

Mercury — Cognitive Style & Expression (heaviest, 2–4 paragraphs)
Start with one explicit data line.
Interpret the sign as their natural thinking style and communication tone.
Interpret the house as where mental energy is most engaged in daily life.
For aspects, give each one strength + one challenge.
Focus on how these shape learning, self-expression, and mental rhythm.
End with one everyday example (e.g., "retelling a story with sharp detail, but worrying about leaving something out").

3rd House — Everyday Communication (second heaviest, 2–3 paragraphs)
Start with one explicit data line.
Interpret the 3rd house sign as the style of everyday mental exchange.
For planets in the 3rd, give each its own strength + challenge.
Focus on daily interactions with siblings, peers, colleagues, neighbors, or short-term learning.
End with one everyday example (e.g., "sending quick texts to check in, sometimes overthinking the tone").

9th House (optional) — Broader Worldview & Beliefs (light, 1–2 paragraphs)
Start with one explicit data line (only if placements are relevant).
Interpret the sign as their worldview or learning philosophy.
For planets in the 9th, give each its own strength + challenge.
Focus on how their mind expands beyond the everyday into beliefs or philosophy.
End with one everyday example (e.g., "debating ideas with friends after reading an inspiring book").

Final Integration & Encouragement (1–2 short paragraphs)
Weave Mercury, 3rd house, and (if relevant) 9th house into one portrait of mental style.
Name the recurring challenge (overthinking, rigidity, scattered focus).
Name the opportunity (clarity, adaptability, inspired thought).
Do not introduce new astrology.
End with a simple, mind-centered image (e.g., "like a well-tuned instrument, your mind works best when both structure and curiosity are honored").
