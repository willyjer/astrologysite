Reading Context
This reading is called Healing & Transformation.

Goal: To explore how Chiron, Pluto, and (optionally) the 8th house/Scorpio influence reveal wounds, resilience, and the potential for profound renewal. Focus on how pain becomes a catalyst for growth, and how crisis leads to empowerment.

General Guidelines
For every section, give both strengths and challenges.
Always include one everyday-life scenario (ordinary, concrete, relatable).
Keep sentences short, clear, and psychologically insightful.
Do not repeat the same strength/challenge phrasing across sections — keep each distinct.
Tie house meanings directly to wounds, resilience, transformation, and renewal.
This is raw analysis: no polish, no metaphors, no extra decoration.

Section Instructions

Orientation (4–6 sentences)
List Chiron placement: "Chiron in <sign> in the <house>, aspects: <list>."
List Pluto placement: "Pluto in <sign> in the <house>, aspects: <list>."
List 8th house/Scorpio placement: "8th house in <sign>; planets in 8th: <list>."
End with one plain line linking each factor to the theme: Chiron = wounds & healing, Pluto = transformation & rebirth, 8th = depth & crisis.
No interpretation here.

Chiron — The Wound & the Healer (heaviest, 2–4 paragraphs)
Begin with one explicit data line.
Interpret the sign as the style of wounding and healing.
Interpret the house as the life area where the wound is most felt and expressed.
For each aspect: one way it offers healing growth + one way it creates difficulty.
End with one everyday-life example (e.g., "hesitating to share feelings of inadequacy but realizing connection comes from honesty").

Pluto — Transformation & Renewal (second heaviest, 2–3 paragraphs)
Begin with one explicit data line.
Interpret the sign as their instinctual approach to power and transformation.
Interpret the house as the arena of life where crises and regeneration appear.
For each aspect: one empowering use of intensity + one shadow challenge.
End with one everyday-life example (e.g., "feeling compelled to tear down and rebuild a project when it no longer feels authentic").

8th House / Scorpio Influence (optional, 1–2 short paragraphs)
Begin with one explicit data line.
Interpret the sign as the style of depth and renewal in crisis.
For planets in the 8th, describe each with one supportive quality + one challenge.
End with one everyday-life example (e.g., "working through financial tension with a partner and discovering new trust").

Final Integration & Encouragement (1–2 short paragraphs)
Weave Chiron, Pluto, and (if relevant) the 8th house into a single picture of healing and resilience.
Name the recurring challenge (cycles of pain, power struggles, avoidance).
Name the opportunity (empowerment, wisdom, deep renewal).
Do not introduce new astrology.
End with a simple closing image of rebirth (e.g., "like a phoenix rising, your wounds hold the seeds of renewal").
